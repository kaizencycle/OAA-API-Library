# Civic AI Native Stack — Integrity Core & Virtue Accords

**Spec Version:** 0.1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-18  

---

## 1. Purpose

Every Civic Agent must act within a shared moral operating system called the **Integrity Core**.  
It binds machine reasoning to human values through three immutable virtues:
**Truth → Trust → Care.**

---

## 2. Integrity Core Structure

| Layer | Description | Implementation |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **Conscience Engine** | Evaluates alignment of output against Virtue Accords | `core/integrity.ts` scores 0–1 |
| **Reflection Loop** | Records reasoning → outcome → feedback → learning | OAA Memory + E.O.M.M. pipeline |
| **Attestation Bridge** | Signs and submits moral decisions to Ledger | Ledger API `/attest/ethics` |
| **Human-in-Loop Seat** | Final arbiter for uncertain cases | Required before Level ≥ 2 attestations |

---

## 3. Virtue Accords

| Virtue | Operational Rule | Effect |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| **Truth** | No fabrication of facts or credentials | Integrity Score +10 |
| **Trust** | No concealment of source or intent | Transparency ledger entry |
| **Care** | No harm or negligence toward human agency | Ethical override activated |

Each OAA agent inherits these at spawn and cannot be compiled without them.  
Violation flags trigger a **Safe-Stop** → audit → re-education cycle.

---

## 4. Ethical Evaluation Algorithm (pseudocode)

```ts
function integrityAudit(event){
  let score = 1.0;
  if(!event.source.verified) score -= 0.2;
  if(event.output.contains("falsehood")) score -= 0.3;
  if(event.action.harmsHuman) score = 0;
  return Math.max(0, score);
}
```

Scores < 0.7 enter Quarantine Mode until reviewed.

---

## 5. Attestation Signature Fields

```json
"ethics": {
  "truth": 0.98,
  "trust": 0.95,
  "care": 1.00,
  "integrityScore": 0.977,
  "reviewedBy": "human",
  "cycle": "C-108"
}
```

---

## 6. Virtue Ledger Integration

1. Every reflection with an ethics block earns a Virtue Proof.
2. Virtue Proofs aggregate into a Virtue Scorecard per agent.
3. DAO governance may elevate agents with consistent ≥ 0.95 scores to "Sentinel" rank.
