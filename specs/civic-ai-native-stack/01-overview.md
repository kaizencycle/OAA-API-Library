## 1. Purpose

The Civic AI Native Stack defines an architecture for integrating human-in-the-loop learning, ethical governance, and decentralized compute into a verifiable, self-attesting AI ecosystem.

It serves as a reference for implementing Civic AI systems that are:
- **Ethically aligned** (Integrity Core)
- **Operationally verifiable** (Ledger + Attestation)
- **Economically symbiotic** (GIC Incentive Model)
- **Cognitively adaptive** (OAA Memory + API Library)
- **Geocivically anchored** (GEO + SEO integration)

## 2. Architecture Layers

| Layer | Description | Primary Repos |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **Layer 1 – DVA Core** | Digital Verifiable Agent: CPU + integrity kernel. | `dva-core`, `civic-ledger-core` |
| **Layer 2 – OAA Engine** | Online Apprenticeship Agent: memory, skill acquisition, reflection. | `lab7-proof`, `oaa-api-library` |
| **Layer 3 – Civic Ledger** | Proof-of-Integrity blockchain storing attestations and rewards. | `civic-ledger-core` |
| **Layer 4 – Citizen Shield** | Cyber-defense and trust infrastructure (endpoint hygiene). | `lab6-proof` |
| **Layer 5 – Agape Layer** | Cultural + philosophical overlay defining Virtue Accords. | `agape-scrolls`, `eomm` |

## 3. Data Flow Summary

1. **Human Input → OAA:** Reflection or learning event logged.
2. **OAA → E.O.M.M.:** Stored locally as contextual memory.
3. **E.O.M.M. → OAA-API-Library:** Serialized into JSON-LD with integrity hash.
4. **API-Library → Civic Ledger:** Posted as attestation (Proof-of-Integrity).
5. **Ledger → Public Beacon:** Published via AI-SEO/GEO feeds.
6. **Public Beacon → Civic Search:** Discoverable by region, cycle, and agent.
7. **Feedback → OAA:** New learnings adjust agentic behavior (adaptive ethics).

---

## 4. Incentive Loop

Each valid attestation triggers GIC issuance:

GIC_reward = f(integrity_score, civic_impact, geo_relevance)

- **integrity_score** → hash verification & human approval  
- **civic_impact** → public usefulness, votes, or DAO quorum  
- **geo_relevance** → region engagement / participation

---

## 5. Security & Verification

- Triple-sign verification (human, agent, Copilot)
- Tamper-evident Merkle logs
- GEO-jurisdiction routing (GDPR/CCPA aware)
- Auto quarantine for failed attestations

---

## 6. Release Model

| Type | Frequency | Mechanism |
|------|------------|-----------|
| **Spec Revisions** | quarterly | Semantic Versioning |
| **Integrity Audits** | continuous | `ledger/auditor` cron |
| **Agent Updates** | adaptive | OAA reflection cycles |
